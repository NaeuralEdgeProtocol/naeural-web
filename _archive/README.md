# Tokenomics

## Introduction into the Naeural Edge Protocol tokenomics

The tokenomics of the Naeural Edge Protocol are meticulously designed to enhance the ecosystem's durability and expansion. As a core **utility ERC-20 token**, the Naeural Edge Protocol token functions as the principal currency facilitating transactions throughout the network. This tokenomics framework aims to reward all ecosystem contributors â€” developers, node operators, and users alike â€” encouraging active participation and sustained growth.

Since the Naeural Edge Protocol token operates as a utility token rather than a security token, its primary function lies in facilitating operational activities within the Naeural ecosystem, rather than speculative trading. It empowers users to contribute computing power, access diverse services, deploy applications, and eventually partake in governance processes. Consequently, there has not been, nor is there any intention for, a **Token Generation Event (TGE)** or **Initial Coin/Token Offering (ICO/IDO)** associated with the Naeural Edge Protocol token. All tokens, including those held in the Foundation's treasury, are distributed through **Naeural Edge Node (NEN) licenses** (Node Deeds) and the Naeural Edge Protocol decentralized application (dApp). These Node Deeds come in three forms: **Genesis Node Deed (GND)**, **Master Node Deed (MND)**, and **Node Deed (ND)**."

> [NOTICE]
> The token reward system serves as an authentic Artificial Intelligence mining mechanism. It incentivizes your node's contribution, whether it's a personal PC, cloud VM, or data center hardware, to various aspects such as AI training, inference, endpoint provisioning, business rules execution, and protocol security. Your role, akin to manual labor, entails supplying power, provisioning hardware, installing software, maintaining the computer(s), and connecting the node(s) to the Internet, thereby supporting the protocol.

### Genesis Node Deed (GND)
A singular issuance exclusive to the **Naeural Edge Protocol Foundation**, the **Genesis Node Deed (GND)** activates the "edge node zero," the Foundation's virtual compute node. This activation is crucial for generating tokens allocated to the publicly disclosed Foundation token pools detailed further below. Essentially, the GND serves as the catalyst for initiating the entire Naeural Edge Protocol ecosystem.

### Master Node Deed (MND)
A specialized node license that will be allocated to both the development team and initial investors. This deed plays a pivotal role in supporting and sustaining the core functions of the ecosystem. The emission period for MND spans over a duration of more than 36 months.

### Node Deed (ND)
The license available for public purchase which enables the operation of individual edge nodes within the Naeural Edge Protocol ecosystem. These nodes are crucial for powering and maintaining the network's decentralized infrastructure. Unlike the emission strategy for MNDs, NDs are emitted at a faster rate, ensuring a prolonged vesting period.


## Pure utility token

Our utility token is intricately designed to serve as the fuel for the Naeural Edge Protocol ecosystem, enabling a smooth and efficient operation across various functionalities. Here is an enhanced clarification of the utility tokenâ€™s purpose and limitations:

**Defined Utility:** The token acts as the operational gas required for processing jobs, allocating compute time, provisioning GPU resources, and acquiring licenses. It is essential for all transactional processes within the protocol, ensuring that each action is executed seamlessly.

**No Financial Entitlements:** Holders of the token will not receive any form of financial returns such as dividends, profit shares, interest, or other benefits typically associated with investments in the DeFi space. The token is strictly a utility mechanism within the Naeural Edge Protocol.

**Exclusively Non-Investment:** The primary function of our token is to facilitate transactions within the Naeural Edge Protocolâ€™s ecosystem. It is specifically designed to support operational efficiency and is not intended for speculative trading or as an investment vehicle. 


## The Naeural Edge Protocol Treasury

## Naeural Edge Protocol tokenomics allocation
The Naeural Edge Protocol features a robust tokenomics structure with a fixed total supply of **1,618,033,988** tokens, a figure inspired by the Golden Ratio â€” a mathematical constant observed in natural and human-made structures, from the spirals of galaxies to the design of artworks and molecular structures. This number not only highlights the protocolâ€™s dedication to balance and sustainability but also symbolizes its commitment to organic growth and technological evolution. Finally, for us this particular number signifies the human-centric approach for advancement of AI and blockchain technologies.

Unique to our approach is the absence of token generation events such as TGEs or ICO/IDO events. Instead, the entire token supply will be fully mined, released through the contribution of computational power by participants who operate edge nodes. This method ensures a finite and transparent token distribution from the start, aligning with our goal of a fully decentralized and participant-driven ecosystem.

Token distribution is intricately designed around the issuance of licenses, referred to as Node Deeds, available in three distinct forms. This framework supports our protocolâ€™s philosophy and operational dynamics, fostering an equitable and scalable network.

## Node Deeds pricing schema

The Naeural Edge Protocol employs a unique anti-inflationary pricing strategy for its Node Deeds, which are essential NFT-licenses for each Edge Node within the ecosystem. This method systematically increases the cost of Node Deeds as more are purchased, ensuring that only genuine economic factors drive their acquisition. This tiered pricing model is designed to mitigate speculative buying and promote a stable growth environment for the network. For instance, the "Universal (no zone boundary)" Node Deed starts at a price of $500 during the first stage with 100 units available. As demand increases and these initial units are sold, the price escalates to $1,000 in the second stage for the next 250 units, and further to $2,500 for 300 units in the third stage. This pattern is mirrored in specific zones labeled A, B, and C, with starting prices at $2,500 and sharply rising through subsequent stagesâ€”reaching up to $50,000 in stage V. Each zone follows a similar escalation, underscoring the protocol's commitment to controlling inflation and ensuring that Node Deeds are acquired for their intended utility rather than for speculative purposes.

The approach not only aligns with Naeuralâ€™s ethos of democratizing AI via blockchain but also ensures that the growth of the network is economically sustainable. By increasing prices as more deeds are purchased, Naeural effectively controls the rate of expansion, aligns Node Deed ownership with actual usage and contribution to the ecosystem, and secures the network's long-term viability. This strategy exemplifies a thoughtful integration of economic principles with technological innovation, aiming to foster a robust and equitable ecosystem.

> Important Notice: Please be aware that the boundaries and definitions of Zones A-C are currently under review and have yet to be finalized. These specifics are subject to discussion and will be determined through DAO voting to ensure community consensus. Additionally, we are considering the option to continue issuing Universal (no zone boundary) Node Deeds. Should this path be chosen, pricing adjustments will be implemented as already presented above to safeguard against inflationary pressures on processing power, ensuring the sustainability of our ecosystem.
